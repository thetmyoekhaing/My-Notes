### Range Characteristics
#### ==if the leading term has odd power, the range is (-∞, ∞ )====

#### ==if the leading term has even power, the range is \[0, ∞ )==

### Linear 
Range for any linear function such as  y = x + 3 is R(-∞ , ∞)

### Parabola (the U shaped graph)

examples

\1. y = x^2 

if the leading term has even power, the range is \[0, ∞ )

\2.  y = x^2 - 3

the lowest y value = -3

the highest y = ∞ 

range => R\[-3 ,∞ )

\3. y = 4 - x^2

the lowest y value = -∞  (because of negative x squared)

the highest y value = 4

range => (-∞, 4\]

### Quadratic Expressions

y = x^2 - 4x + 5

to find x value , formula => x = -b/2a

x = -(-4)/2(1) = 2

y = 2^2 - 4(2) + 5

y = 4 - 8 + 5

y = 1

lowest y value = 1

highest y value = ∞ 

range => R\[1, ∞ )


### Cubic Polynomials

it has a leading term of odd so it will be (-∞, ∞ )

### Absolute Value

example 

\1. y = |x|

range => \[0, ∞) as shown in the top diagram
\2. y = |x| + 3

range => \[3, ∞)

\3.  y = |x-2| - 3

range => \[-3, ∞)


\4. y = 2 - |x-3|

range => (-∞, 2\]
