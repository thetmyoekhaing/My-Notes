**Domain of a Function**: The set of all possible inputs for the function.

**For all polynomials** 

\ f(x) = 2x - 7
\ f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 5

\the domain of the function is D(-∞ , ∞)



**For rationals**
f(x) = 5 / x-2 
the denominator cant be 0
x - 2 != 0
x != 2
the domain of the function is D(-∞ , 2) U D(2, ∞)

f(x) = 2x - 3 / x^2 + 4
x^2 + 4 != 0
x^2 != -4
x^2 != -4 is never equal to zero thus the domain of the function is  D(-∞ , ∞)

**for √**
f(x) = √x-4
**for roots of index number is even , we cant have  negative number in the inside**
x - 4 >= 0
x >= 4
the domain of the function is \[4,∞)

**Exceptions Summary**:

- Polynomials: No exceptions
- Rational Functions: Exclude points where denominator is zero
- Square Roots: Ensure non-negative radicand and avoid negative numbers under even root.
